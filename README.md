The purpose of this website is to showcase my personal coding skills, provide an overview of portfolio projects, and give a sense of my background and experience. It has been built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes popular frameworks like Bootstrap for styling.

## How to Use

<li>Clone the repository.</li>
<li>Open the project files in your coding editor like VS Code.</li>
<li>Open the HTML file in your browser.</li>

## Future Improvments

I will update this website as new skills are learned and projects are completed.
